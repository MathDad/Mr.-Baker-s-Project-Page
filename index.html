      <p class="page1text">You've landed on Mr. Baker's project page. This is a place where I, Mr. Baker, am planning to showcase some of the projects that I have completed and also to post my resume.  </p>
      <p class="page1text">I have been a teacher at Charlotte High School for over 10 years now and the last 5 have been defined by teaching computer science. During that time I would characterize my role as lead learner.  Although I didn't go to college for a degree in Computer Science, I believe I have the mindset of one; a creative problem solver.   Please enjoy navigating my website and browsing my projects! Backerbuck and Zoinks coming soon</p>
