      <h3 class="resumeHeader">Backstory</h3><br>
      <p>As a high school math teacher, I was regularly confronted by students to account for a practical use of math content.  While looking for the answer, I stumbled across computer science and spent a few years learning to code in Python and Java.  Eventually there was the opportunity to teach computer science at my school, which I have been doing since 2017.   I have taught an Intro to Coding class and also an AP Computer Science course in JavaScript through Code.org.  This experience has piqued my interest in software development. <i>I am looking to join a company that values creativity in problem solving and is willing to coach and direct my growth in this field.</i></p><br>
