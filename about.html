        <p class="othelloPage">To play othello you need to pick a tile that is opposite a tile that is also your color "pinching" the other color tile between two of your own.  Pinched pieces flip to your color.  You can pinch pieces up/down, left/right and diagonal. Players take turns capturing pieces.  If there is ever a time that you can't play, the other player takes another turn. </p>

        <h2 class="othelloPage">A Digital Recreation of Othello with AI</h2>
        <p class="othelloPage">I have four children and we had been playing the classic othello game at home.  But, as happens with young children, the gameboard kept getting bumped and we had to try to put the board back the way it was.  And then I had the idea of making a digital version of the game so you couldn't bump the game.  The hardest part was trying to figure out how to explain to the computer legal moves.  I eventually used a function that would search in the cardinal directions recursivly and it worked! </p>
