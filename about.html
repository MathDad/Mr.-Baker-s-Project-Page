          <h2 class="othelloPage">A Digital Recreation of Othello</h2>
          <p class="othelloPage">I have four children and we had been playing the classic othello game at home.  But, as happens with young children, the gameboard kept getting bumped and we had to try to put the board back the way it was.  And then I had the idea of making a digital version of the game so you couldn't bump the game.  The hardest part was trying to figure out how to explain to the computer legal moves.  I eventually used a function that would search in the cardinal directions recursivly and it worked! In 2022 I added a version of the game where you could play against the computer.  It uses an algorithm to choose the min possible capture, the max possible captures or somewhere in between.</p>
